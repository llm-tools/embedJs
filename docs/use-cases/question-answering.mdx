## Example: Build a Q&A System with EmbedJs for Next.JS

Quickly create a RAG pipeline to answer queries about the [Next.JS Framework](https://nextjs.org/) using EmbedJs tools.

### Step 1: Set Up Your RAG Pipeline

First, let's create your RAG pipeline. Open your NodeJs application and add the following code:

```ts Create pipeline
import { RAGApplicationBuilder } from '@llm-tools/embedjs';
import { OpenAi } from '@llm-tools/embedjs-openai';
import { HNSWDb } from '@llm-tools/embedjs-hnswlib';

const app = await new RAGApplicationBuilder()
.setModel(SIMPLE_MODELS.OPENAI_GPT4_O)
.setEmbeddingModel(new OpenAiEmbeddings())
.setVectorDatabase(new HNSWDb())
.build();
```

This initializes your application.

### Step 2: Populate Your Pipeline with Data

Now, let's add data to your pipeline. We'll include the Next.JS website and its documentation:

```ts Ingest data sources
import { SitemapLoader } from '@llm-tools/embedjs-loader-sitemap';

//Add Next.JS Website and docs
app.addLoader(new SitemapLoader({ url: "https://nextjs.org/sitemap.xml" }))

//Add Next.JS Forum data
app.addLoader(new SitemapLoader({ url: "https://nextjs-forum.com/sitemap.xml" }))
```

This step incorporates over **15K pages** from the Next.JS website and forum into your pipeline. For more data source options, check the [EmbedJs data sources overview](/components/data-sources/overview).

### Step 3: Local Testing of Your Pipeline

Test the pipeline on your local machine:

```ts Query App
app.query("Summarize the features of Next.js 14?")
```

Run this query to see how your pipeline responds with information about Next.js 14.
