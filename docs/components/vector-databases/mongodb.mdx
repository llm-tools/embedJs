[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-vector-search) is an open source document database.
The company behind the open source product offers a managed cloud product **MongoDB Atlas**.
As of right now, only the Atlas version supports vector search while the open source version does not.

To use MongoDB as your vector database, follow these steps -

-   Sign up for a MongoDB Atlas account if you haven't already. Once you have signed up, you will need to spin up a new cluster (or use an existing one)

<Note>
You will need to provision a M10 (or higher) instance type to use Atlas vector search. Cheaper instance types or the free version (M0) give an error when vector indexes are created programatically.
</Note>

-   The cluster creation takes a few minutes. Once the cluster is ready, click on the connect button on the dashboard to get the connection string.

<Note>
You will need to add users separately and allow IP access from your relevant development and production environments.
