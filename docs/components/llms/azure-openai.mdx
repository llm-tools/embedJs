In order to be able to use OpenAI models on Azure, they first need to be deployed.
Please refer to [Azure OpenAI documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/) on how to deploy a model on Azure.

Once these models are deployed, using Azure OpenAI is easy to do. Just follow these steps -

-   Set the following environment variables -

```bash
AZURE_OPENAI_API_INSTANCE_NAME=<YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME>
AZURE_OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME>
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION="2024-02-01" #or a newer version
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY>
```

## Install OpenAI addon

```bash
npm install @llm-tools/embedjs-openai
```

## Usage

```ts
import { RAGApplicationBuilder } from '@llm-tools/embedjs';
import { AzureOpenAi } from '@llm-tools/embedjs-openai';

const app = await new RAGApplicationBuilder()
.setModel(new AzureOpenAi({ model: "gpt-4o" }))
```

<Note>
To use Azure Managed Identity, you can use something similar to the following code snippet -

```ts
import {
  DefaultAzureCredential,
  getBearerTokenProvider,
} from "@azure/identity";
import { AzureOpenAi } from '@llm-tools/embedjs-openai';

const credentials = new DefaultAzureCredential();
const azureADTokenProvider = getBearerTokenProvider(
  credentials,
  "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default"
);

const app = new AzureOpenAI({
  azureADTokenProvider,
  azureOpenAIApiInstanceName: "<your_instance_name>",
  azureOpenAIApiDeploymentName: "<your_deployment_name>",
  azureOpenAIApiVersion: "<api_version>",
});
```
</Note>
