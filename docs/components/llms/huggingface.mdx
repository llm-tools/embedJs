Hugging face needs no introduction. They host a variety of open source LLMs and you can use most of them for free. To run hugging face inference based LLMs with this library, you will need a free hugging face token.

You can get an API Token by signing up for hugging face and generate a token from [this page](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens). Once you get the token, set it to the environment like so -

```bash
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_KEY="<Your hf key>"
```

## Install Huggingface addon

```bash
npm install @llm-tools/embedjs-huggingface
```

import { RAGApplicationBuilder } from '@llm-tools/embedjs';
import { HuggingFace } from '@llm-tools/embedjs-huggingface';

const app = await new RAGApplicationBuilder()
